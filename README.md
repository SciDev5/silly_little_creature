# Silly Little Creature

A little desktop buddy that you can play hide and seek with (She hides in your windows (she's in your walls)).

Click on her while she's peeking out to catch her!


THIS IS A PROTOTYPE - Things may break.
- Avoid resizing windows, moving them is fine tho.
- Close the app by clicking on her and pressing Alt+F4
- Enter debug mode with `ctrl+d`
- Does not work on Mac or Linux (vewry sadge)



## Game Jam Statement:
This game was made in 3 days, one of which I spent the latter half of hanging out with friends instead of working lol.
- Day 1: Engine coding day. (yes, this did need a custom engine, yes I did build it, no I am not sane, yes I did build it by repurposing my spectrogram code)
- Day 2: Windows API wrestling day. "what is hwnd? wdym the window is 0 by 0 pixels? why does my screenshot look like it was chewed up by a dog?" ...and implementing hiding (using canny edge detection).
- Day 3: Frantic scramble to make it presentable. (Was it worth it to stay the night and not resume work until the afternoon? Yes, but I didn't get a lot of art and polish time lol).
